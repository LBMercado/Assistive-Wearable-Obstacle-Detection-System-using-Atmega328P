# Assistive Wearable Obstacle Detection System using Atmega328P
 Software part of the design entitled "Assistive Wearable Obstacle Detection System For The Visually Impaired Using The Atmega328p Microcontroller". This makes use of the Arduino platform to achieve the design's objectives, mainly:
- To detect potential causes of collisions and provide the wearer information about objects and people in proximity through haptic feedback and auditory warnings.
- To use the ATmega328 Microcontroller as the microcontroller for the design project.
- To determine the effectivity of the device in detecting different types of obstacles.
